# Home_Sales

## Decription

For this project, we are using spark and spark sql to make various queries to analyze home sale data.  In addition, we try out different techniques to speed up these queries -- including caching and partitioning.  We found that caching had very little effect on the performance of the query and partioning by the 'date_built' column actually made the query slower.
